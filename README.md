The Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone project focused on Salifort Motors, a leading automobile manufacturer. The objective was to analyze and leverage data to optimize various aspects of the company's operations, including production, sales, and customer satisfaction.

I started by collecting and integrating data from multiple sources, including production records, sales transactions, customer feedback, and market trends. Through data cleaning and preprocessing, I ensured data accuracy and consistency.

Using statistical analysis techniques, I identified patterns and trends in the data to gain insights into production efficiency, sales performance, and customer preferences. This enabled me to make data-driven recommendations for improving operational efficiency, identifying popular vehicle models, and optimizing the supply chain.

Additionally, I conducted sentiment analysis on customer feedback data to understand customer satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement. This information was instrumental in enhancing customer experience, guiding product development, and tailoring marketing strategies to meet customer expectations.

To predict future sales and demand, I developed machine learning models that incorporated historical sales data, market trends, and external factors. These models provided accurate forecasts, allowing Salifort Motors to optimize inventory management, production planning, and sales strategies.

Throughout the project, I utilized data visualization techniques to create interactive dashboards and reports. These visually appealing representations of the data facilitated easy interpretation and helped stakeholders understand key insights and trends at a glance.

The Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone project on Salifort Motors showcased my ability to handle complex datasets, apply advanced statistical analysis, and derive actionable insights. It demonstrated my skills in leveraging data to drive decision making and provided valuable recommendations to enhance Salifort Motors' operational efficiency, sales performance, and customer satisfaction.
